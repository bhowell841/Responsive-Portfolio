                    <p>Raised by wolves in the Saskatchewan wilderness of Canada.  Once found and rescued by humans he was given the family name Howell, because it is a play on howl.  Wolves.  Get it.  Hilarious. Early life didn't provide many options for Brendan to develop adequate social skills.  Thus you have the socially inept man in front of you today.  The wilderness did provide Brendan the ability to develop and hone 
                        many survival skills including but not limited to making a mean cup of coffee and grilling a fantastic hamburger.  Growing up in a pack of wolves Brendan had to be quick, but unfortunately he is not.  Which explains how he was eventually captured by humans.  He did develop the ability to run for long distances.  Ridiculously long distances, usually relatively quickly.  Brendan does not know what else to write, so the remainer of this bio will be Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, an nostro pertinacia per, accusam repudiandae ad ius. Ut dicat dolor mei. Integre delenit ius eu. Per ut exerci detracto, adhuc graeci audiam te cum, solum tempor ex vis. Cum altera iriure consetetur ea, lorem appareat intellegat vix te. Ut sea posse dignissim, duo expetenda dissentiunt in, in vim errem alterum argumentum. Ad eam illud contentiones, mel at molestie apeirian.</p>
                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                    <p>Also, born and raised in NY, never been to Saskatchewan.  Also, I have been to Canada, very nice country.  Also, there was no good reason to write this in the third person.  Also, I do run ridiculously long distances.  Also, I like the word also.</p>
